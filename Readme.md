Objective: develop a humour detection system to determine humourous text in a dataset. 

Methods: Splitting up a dataset into training and testing data to test engineered features with supervised learning classifiers (K-Nearest Neighbors, Decision Trees, Na√Øve Bayes Methods, and SGD) to determine the strength of the features to develop strong humour detection. 

Results: The highest resulting test classifier was a KNN classifier with n=7 neighbors which returned a 0.73 (73%) confidence value with 13 features with individual confidence scores ranging from 0.41-0.62 which all performed above the minimum goal for individual confidence scores of 0.40.
